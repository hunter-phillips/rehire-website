        <p>
          The Office of Residence Life & Student Conduct's mission is to provide "a safe, supportive community that
          encourages holistic growth." A Resident Assistant's (RA) goal should be to implement and fulfill this
          mission through educational programs, meaningful conversations, and community building.
        </p>
        <div class="col-lg-11 text-center mx-auto col-12">

          <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
            <h2>Educational Programs</h2>
          </div>

        </div>
        <p>
          RAs utilize the pillars and goals of the ANCHORS framework to develop thoughtful programs that encourage
          students to step outside of their comfort zone. Through entertaining activities and thought-provoking
          discussions, students learn to embrace diversity, sustainability, and consent. They also discover how to
          engage with their peers and community through socializing and volunteering. With each program, residents
          have an opportunity to further their understanding of society and themselves.
        </p>
        <div class="col-lg-11 text-center mx-auto col-12">

          <div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto">
            <h2>Meaningful Conversations</h2>
          </div>

        </div>
        <p>
          Throughout the semester, RAs frequently interact with residents. Whether it’s a one on one, lunch, or on the
          way to class, these seemingly insignificant conversations help residents develop a profound sense of
          belonging and comfort. These interactions allow residents to feel comfortable with RAs, and they open new
          doors to growth. At incidents, residents are more likely to listen and respond positively to RAs as they
          enforce policy to keep everyone safe. Residents also find it easier to reach out in times of need, whether
          its for academic assistance, mental health issues, or regarding roommate problems. This ensures residents
          feel supported and accepted.

            <h2>Community Building</h2>
          </div>

        </div>
        <p>
          Through educational programs, meaningful conversations, door decorations, and a plethora of other activities,
          RAs foster community among residents. Programs give residents an opportunity to meet students outside of the
          classroom or their sport of choice. Door decorations also provide a chance for residents to know those people
          they live around. Additionally, they make the bland hallways homier. These activities create a supportive
          community that truly makes “Hurst is Home” ring true.

          </div>

        </div>
        <p>
          During the 2021-2022 academic year, I have helped develop a strong, supportive community in Warde Hall through
          programs, meaningful conversations, and community building. Out of the three, meaningful conversations have
          been the most impactful on my residents. From day one, I emphasized that my role as an RA was to be there for
          their academic, mental, and social needs. This helped my residents see me as more than just a policy enforcer.
          Instead, they see me as a resource and someone they can trust. At incidents, this has caused them to be much
          more understanding and reasonable, and they have been unafraid to reach out afterwards. Similarly, my programs
          and other community building activities, which can be seen <a href="portfolio.html">here</a>, have helped my
          residents better
          understand their emotional health, consent, the academic resources available to them on campus, diversity, and
          more! Each of these conversations and activities have sharpened my social abilities and increased my overall
          knowledge, and I plan to use everything I've learned to continue helping even more students next year!
